  - `run_analysis.R` - R script to merge, clean-up, transform, and summarize the experiment data.
  - `data_summary.txt` - Output from the `run_analysis.R` script.
  - `README.md` - This file.

### Getting started

  1. Read through the [CodeBook](CodeBook.md) and the [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) to understand the steps taken to transform the data from it's original raw state 
  to it's the outputted tidy state
  
  2. Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and extract.
  
  3. Run  `run_analysis.R` to generate the output file.
